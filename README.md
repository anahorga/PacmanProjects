# Berkeley AI Projects: Search, Multiagent, and Reinforcement Learning

This repository contains solutions to several AI projects from the **Berkeley AI** course, focusing on **Search**, **Multiagent Systems**, and **Reinforcement Learning**.

## Project Folders

### 1. **Search**
The **Search** folder contains implementations of various search algorithms used to solve optimization and decision-making problems.

### 2. **Multiagent**
The **Multiagent** folder explores the interaction between multiple agents within a shared environment. 

### 3. **Reinforcement Learning**
The **Reinforcement Learning** folder implements algorithms like **Q-learning** and policy learning techniques for training agents to make decisions based on rewards and penalties.
